# Ignore all files in the home directory.
# We'll only track files specifically added
# to yadm.
# 
# It's still useful to have this .gitignore
# here even though yadm has this behavior
# by default.
# 
# yadm status will only show tracked files.
# However, yadm add . will try to add 
# EVERY file, including untracked ones.
# 
# This .gitignore helps yadm behave more as
# I expect it to.
